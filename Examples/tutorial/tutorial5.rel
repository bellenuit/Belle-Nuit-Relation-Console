' ===Projection===' Project filters the table by columns. You specify the columns you want to keep' We reuse the table [[Media:films.csv]]' Look at the code on the right and compare with the result.' ''''Show only the title and the year'''''read "films.csv"project film, yearprint ' '''''Show only the director'''''read "films.csv"project directorprint ' You may notice we only have 4 rows instead of 9. This is because there are only 4 directors for these 9 films. In set theory, there cannot be duplicate values. ' NB: In SQL you would get 9 rows, unless you use the DISTINCT option (which you should always).' '''''Show the director first, then the title'''''read "films.csv"project director, filmprint ' Project allows you to reorder the columns, too.' Go to [[Tutorial 6]]
