' ''Allocate seats on a fictional national level'''' We first simplify and assume a single constituency of 200 deputees.' We add all voters per party and ignore the ""other"" parties votes.' Hagenbach-Bischoff is equivalent to d'Hondt. Divide voters with all dividers and then order by ratio and limit to the number of seats.' We use a while loop to create a number list. We save it for later use as [[Media:numberlist.csv]].' We print only the first lines.read "ef2019.csv"select partei !== "Ãœbrige"project partei, fiktive_waehlende sumrelation numberset i = 0while i < 60set i = i+1insert iend whilewrite "numberlist.csv"join crossextend quotient = fiktive_waehlende_sum/numberorder quotient 9limit 1 200print 10' This gives the following national seat allocation.
