' ===Relations===' * A '''relation''' is a set of zero or more tuples that share the same properties.' * The '''cardinality''' of a relation is the number of tuples. The empty relation {} or âˆ… has no tuples and the cardinality 0.' * A '''tuple''' is a set of zero or more property-value pairs. Each property has its domain. A domain is the set of all possible values. N (set of natural numbers) is a domain for example.' * The '''arity''' is the number of properties of the tuples in a relation. The properties do not have a particular order.' Go to [[Tutorial 3]]
