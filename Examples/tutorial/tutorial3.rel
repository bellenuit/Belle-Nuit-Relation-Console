' ===Tables===' In Belle Nuit Relation, relations are tables, tuples rows and columns properties.' Row and column are not significant and each row is unique.' Tables always have a column header' You can create a table right in Relation. The table below was written with the code you can see on the right of this page.relation id, title, countryinsert 1001, "Ma vie de Courgette", "CH"insert 1002, "Elle", "FR"insert 1003, "Toni Erdmann", "DE"insert 1004, "Above and Below", "CH"print' In Relation, you write '''numbers''' directly and '''text''' should be in quotes. However, the columns are not typed. If id in this example is number or text depends on how you use it in expressions." ' Normally, you will not write data directly into Relation, but from files. For the rest of the tutorial we will use a comma-separated-values file (CSV) [[Media:films.csv]]. You can export CSV from Excel, Numbers and many other application, even write manually.read "films.csv"print' Go to [[Tutorial 4]]
